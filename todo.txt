- Merge the JSON files then sort them by # of starts.
- Start with a sample of 10 repos (then generalize to 100 then all).
  - Download the repo (git clone), then put the repo to Git ignore
    - For example: /google/guava --> google_guava (create only 1 level of directories)
    - Another: /google/guava_v1_1 --> google_guava_v1_1 (replace the first _ when converting back)
  - Extract the number of lines of Java tests (test_loc) and Java code (total_loc), try Python lib "glob"
    - Test files: have "test" in the path (non-case-sensitive)

- Take a look at Seutil

- Code Refactoring
  - Add more proper interfaces when interacting with downloaded repos.
  - Add some tests.
  - Make classes for modular for maintenance.
